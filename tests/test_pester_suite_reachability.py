"""Every Pester suite in the tree must actually be run by a workflow.

`bats --recursive .` discovers suites, so a new Bats file cannot go unrun. Pester's reachability
depends on how the workflow invokes it, and this repo has used two shapes: `run-pester` steps
naming one `path:` each, and a pwsh step setting `$config.Run.Path` and letting Pester discover
recursively. The first can leave a new suite unnamed; the second cannot, but can still be pointed
at a subtree that misses one.

Both are understood here on purpose. A gate that only knew the shape in use on the day it was
written would go quietly vacuous the moment the workflow was rewritten -- which is exactly what
happened: the recursive rewrite left this file asserting that a workflow with no `run-pester`
steps covered nothing, and the honest reading of that is "the gate no longer knows how the suites
are run", not "the suites are unreachable".

A suite nobody runs is worse than no suite: it reads as coverage.
